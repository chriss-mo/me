# Personal Portfolio and Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with React and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. It showcases my projects, hobbies, experience, and contact information. Using React, I modeled the structure of the website after [Sirona Clinical](https://github.com/vinumaradana/PatientMatch), a hackathon project in which I designed the frontend.
