# Hi, I'm Chris Mo  

## About Me  
I am a Data Science and Business Economics student at UC San Diego, and I am most interested in artificial intelligience, data engineering and analytics.
Most of my experience has been in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but I am always looking to learn more about different fields of data science.
