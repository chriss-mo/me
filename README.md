# Hi, I'm Chris Mo  

## About Me  
I am a Data Science and Business Economics student at UC San Diego, and I am most interested in artificial intelligience, data engineering and analytics.
Most of my experience has been in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but I am always looking to learn more about different fields of data science.

  <h3> Sirona Clinical </h3>  
  ([DiamondHacks 2024 Winner](https://devpost.com/software/sirona-clinical))
  Sirona clinical is a program that uses the machine learning technology in Amazon Comprehend Medical to extract medical text and match patients suffering from rare diseases with related clinical trials. Our project won best in category at Diamond Hacks 2024 in the All Hands on Deck category, which emphasizes projects for societal betterment. I created the frontend of the Web App using `React.js` and `Node.js`, and worked with my partners to develop a string similarity algorithm to match tokens extracted by AWS Comprehend Medical to existing clinical trial listings in our database. Sidenote: this was all of our first hackathons, and I came into the weekend with little knowledge about frontend development. All in all, it was an extremely fruitful experience!

  <h3> VCT 2023 Analysis </h3>

  Taking tournament data from the Valorant Champions Tour series in 2023, I created a Dashboard in Tableau to practice skills I had self-taught myself, and preprocessed the data to be used in a predictive model that, based on an individual player or overall team's stats, would tell if the team would win and by how much. I mainly used `scikit-learn` for the classical machine learning models and `tensorflow` for the neural networks. This was also an opportunity for me to apply the machine learning methods I had learned in my classes to an industry I was interested in!

  <h3> NBA Odds Predictor (CSE 151A Class Project Winner) </h3>

  For our quarter-long project, we created machine learning models to predict the money line, as well as other betting statistics for NBA games based on season data from 2008-2023. This was a chance for us to apply what we learned in class, and we experimented with an artificial and convolutional neural network, as well as models not covered in class such as recurrent neural networks. 

  <h3> League23 </h3>

  Final project for DSC 80: Practice and Application of Data Science. Using in-game statistics from the 2023 professional season, we created a project aiming to determine whether or not there exists a "snowball effect" in League of Legends. That is, if a team destroys the first three turrets, how likely are they to win the match? We also employed methods such as hypothesis testing and missingness analysis to ensure our data was processed most appropriately for our task at hand. We used `pandas` to preprocess the data, `plotly-express` to visualize the data, and `scikit-learn` to create a predictive model.

  <h3> Bonus: FIRST Robotics Competition Differential Swerve </h3>
  <details open>
  <summary> See More </summary>
  As the drivetrain lead on the Gunn Robotics Team (GRT), I created one of the world's first differential swerve prototype drivetrains. In a traditional swerve drive, each module (4 total per drivetrain) requires two motors: one for movement and one for rotation of the fork. Using a design inspired by an automotive differential, I created a differential swerve, which can use the power of two motors to drive each wheel when it is not rotating. <br />
